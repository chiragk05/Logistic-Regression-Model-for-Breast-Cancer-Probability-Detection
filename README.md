# Logistic-Regression-Model-for-Breast-Cancer-Probability-Detection
This is going to be the first in a few different small projects into my exploration of Machine Learning as a field, here; I worked with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set to train a logistic regression model to attempt to classify cases of Breast Cancer as either 'Malignant' or 'Benign' based on data about the patient's cancerous cell nuclei.

This code is not meant to be ran in one go, but rather describes what I am aim to with each segment of code.
